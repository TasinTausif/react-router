This project is a **React + Vite** based demo of routing using React Router.  
It showcases how to use multiple routes, navigation, and route-based components in a React application styled with **Tailwind CSS**.

## 📋 Getting Started

### Prerequisites  
- Node.js (v14+ recommended)  
- npm or yarn

### Installation  
    git clone https://github.com/TasinTausif/react-router.git
    cd react-router
    npm install

### Running the app
    npm run dev

Open your browser and go to the URL shown in the terminal ( http://localhost:5173).


## 🎮 How to Use

Use the navigation links in the header to move between pages.

Each route renders a different component (e.g., Home, About).

Observe how the browser’s URL changes and the page content updates without a full page refresh (client-side routing).
